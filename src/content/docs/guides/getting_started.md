description: A guide to getting started with ReScript Fresh.

Welcome to ReScript Fresh! 
Feel free to skip around to the different guides to learn how things work, but all of the guides will assume that you have cloned the starter repo and followed these basic steps.

1. Copy the [starter repo template](https://github.com/jderochervlk/rescript-fresh-starter) on Github by clicking the "Use this template" button.
2. These guides work best if you are using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as a text editor and have installed the recommended extensions from the starter repo.
